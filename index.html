    <p>
      Dr Manmohan Singh, India’s 14th Prime Minister, presided over a decade of
      phenomenal growth and development. Under Dr Singh’s stewardship, India
      witnessed the highest growth rate in its history, averaging at 7.7% to
      become a nearly two trillion-dollar economy. India was catapulted from
      tenth position when Dr Singh took over into the world’s third largest
      economy by 2014, raising the living standard of millions.
